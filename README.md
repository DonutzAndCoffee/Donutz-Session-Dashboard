# Donutz Session Dashboard
<br>This is my current main dashboard which I use for daily races. Currently all features are only tested with iRacing.
<br>Please note that this is still work in progress. Let me know if you find any bugs.
Highlights:
- rejoin indicator for pit stops and spin situations
- tiny "horizontal" track map which shows position of all drivers (on track and on pit road)
- iRating with different color code than usual. iRating which is 500+ higher than yours will be marked with red color
- temporary indicators when changing ABS, TC or BB
- estimated remaining laps based on last 3 laps as average (if race is based on time)
- tire compound and stint length of drivers on relative board.
- experimental: Push to pass info. (still buggy)
- Lovely Track Data implementation. Many thanks to Constantinos for these brilliant ideas! --> https://lsr.gg
